<img id="imagendedioses" src="./images/dioses-del-olimpo.jpg" alt="todos los dioses del olimpo">
<p>In the religion of ancient Greece, the Olympian gods were the main gods of the Greek pantheon, who dwelt on Mount Olympus. Temples, civic festivities, artistic and sports activities were consecrated to them, being considered the most important within the broad set of deities in Greek mythology. In its origins, the first cults date back approximately 5000-6000 years ago, towards 3500 a. C. The cult of the deities of Ancient Greece remains in force in Hellenism.</p>
<p>The concept of "twelve gods" is older than any of the early Greek sources. The word "God" was already attributed at that time to Zeus. There were, at different times, fourteen different gods recognized as Olympians, although never more than twelve at a time. It is from this concept that they are referred to as the Twelve Olympians, also known as Dodekatheon.</p>

<h1>Zeus</h1>
<p>In Greek mythology, Zeus is a divinity sometimes referred to as "father of gods and men," who rules the Olympian gods like a father to a family, so that even those who They were not his natural children, they address him as such. He is the king of the gods and oversees the universe. He is the god of the sky and thunder and therefore of energy. His attributes include the scepter and crown (as symbols of his power), the thunderbolt, the eagle, the bull, and the oak. In addition to his Indo-European heritage, the classic "cloud-gatherer" Zeus also derived certain iconographic features from ancient Near Eastern cultures, such as the scepter. Zeus was commonly depicted by Greek artists in two poses: standing, advancing with a raised thunderbolt in his right hand, and sitting majestically..</p>
<p>Son of Cronos and Rea, he was the youngest of their descendants. In most traditions he appears married to Hera (his sister and wife), although in the Dodona oracle his wife was Dione, with whom according to the Iliad he is the father of Aphrodite, he is known for his many adventures and lovers, the fruit of which were many deities and heroes, including Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helena, Minos, the Muses and nymphs like Eco. With Hera it is often said that Zeus was the father of Ilithia, Ares, Enio, Hebe and Hephaestus.</p>

                <p>he is the god of the seas and, as "Shaker of the Earth", of earthquakes in Greek mythology.</p>
                <p>The tablets in linear B show that Poseidon was worshiped at Pylos and Thebes in late Bronze Age Mycenaean Greece, but was integrated into the later Olympian pantheon as the brother of Zeus and Hades. Poseidon had many children and was protector of many Hellenic cities, although he lost the contest for Athens against Athena. He was dedicated a Homeric hymn. Like other sea gods, he was represented in the shape of a horse.</p>
                <p>Poseidon was an important municipal god of several cities: in Athens, he was second in importance behind only Athena, while in Corinth and in many cities of Magna Graecia he was the chief god of the polis.</p>

                <p>In Greek mythology, Athena is the goddess of war, civilization, wisdom, combat strategy, science, justice, and skill. He was one of the main deities of the Greek pantheon and one of the twelve Olympian gods. Athena was worshiped throughout Ancient Greece and throughout its area of influence, from the Greek colonies of Asia Minor to those of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Their presence is attested even in the vicinity of India. For this reason, his cult took many forms and even had a considerable extension to the point that his figure was syncretized with other deities in the regions bordering the Mediterranean. In Roman mythology she was worshiped by the name of Minerva.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                <p>In Greek mythology, Hades alludes to both the ancient Greek underworld and its god. The word referred to in Homer only the god and the genitive ᾍιδού Haidou was an elision to designate location: ‘the house / domain of Hades’. Finally, the nominative also came to designate the abode of the dead.</p>
                <p>Hades is the eldest son of Cronos and Rhea.</p>
                <p>According to the myth, he and his brothers Zeus and Poseidon defeated the Titans and claimed the rule of the cosmos, claiming the underworld, the sky and the sea, respectively; solid earth, long before the province of Gea, was available to all three at the same time.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                <p>In Greek mythology, Ares is the son of Zeus and Hera, the Olympian god of war.</p>
                <p>In war he represents brutality, violence, and the horrors of battles.As the god of male virility, throughout mythology there have been about thirty female lovers, with a descendant of around 60 children (among them Eros, Harmony, Phobos, Deimos, the Amazons). Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty, was his favorite lover, his healer, and war ally.</p>
                <p>Despite being identified as the god of war, he was not always victorious in combat. In fact, he is wounded several times, as against the demigod Heracles, and especially in his confrontations with his sister Athena, also a warrior divinity, patron of strategy and wisdom. His birthplace and true home was located in the region of the barbarians and Thracians, north of Hellas, and there he fled when he was discovered sleeping with Aphrodite who repeatedly cheated on her husband Hephaestus with him.</p>

                <p>In Greek mythology, Hephaestus is the god of the forge and fire, as well as of blacksmiths, craftsmen, sculptors, metals and metallurgy. He was worshiped in all the industrial and manufacturing centers of Greece, especially in Athens. </p>
                <p>Hephaestus was quite ugly, he was crippled and lame; although his wife was Aphrodite. Even the myth says that, at birth, Hera saw him so ugly that she threw him off Olympus and gave him a limp. So much so, that he walked with the help of a cane and, in some painted vessels, his feet sometimes appear upside down.</p>

                <p>In Greek mythology, Artemis was one of the most revered and oldest deities. It is the Hellenic goddess of hunting, wild animals, virgin land, births, virginity and maidens, who brought and relieved the diseases of women. Daughter of Zeus and Leto, and twin sister of Apollo, and is part of the pantheon of the twelve Olympian gods.</p>
                <p>She was often depicted as a huntress carrying a bow and arrows; the deer and the cypress were consecrated to her. Some researchers believe that her name, and indeed the goddess herself, was originally pre-Greek. In the Iliad she is referred to as Artemis Agrotera, Potnia Theron, 'Artemis of the virgin land, Lady of the Animals.' It is also read in the Iliad that she and Hermes rescued Ares, who had both been chained by the Aloads.</p>

                <p>It is, in Greek mythology, the goddess of beauty, sensuality and love. Its Roman equivalent is Venus. Although she is often referred to in modern culture as "the goddess of love," it is important to note that in the past she did not refer to love in the romantic but the erotic sense.</p>
                <p>Although in mythology she was married to Hephaestus, she had other lovers, Ares being her favorite. Along with his brothers, he held a place in the pantheon among the twelve Olympian gods. Its name gives off meanings, such as the word aphrodisiac, and its name in ancient Roman (Venere) comes to venerate and venereal (referred to the sexual).
